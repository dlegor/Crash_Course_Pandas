# Crash Course Pandas

This repository contains the notebooks of the intensive course that I taught for six weeks in 2018. The intention was to study the "Pandas idiomatic", but first we reviewed topics about Python and Numpy.
Later, I will share more notes on more topics that I consider relevant, unfortunately we could not review them.

Notebook and description:

* [Basic Programming in Python and Basic topic of Numpy.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dlegor/Crash_Course_Pandas/blob/master/Notebooks/Lesson_1.ipynb)
