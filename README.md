# Crash Course Pandas

This repository contains the notebooks of the intensive course that I taught for six weeks in 2018. The intention was to study the "Pandas idiomatic", but first we reviewed topics about Python and Numpy.
Later, I will share more notes on more topics that I consider relevant, unfortunately we could not review them.
